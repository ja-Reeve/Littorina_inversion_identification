This repository contains the code used in a scientific project to identify chromosomal inversions from whole genome data from the rough periwinkle (*Littorina saxatilis*). Samples were collected from across the North Atlantic.

Files are split into R scirpts and bash scripts. bash was used to filter variants and extract genotypes. All other steps in the analysis were conducted with R V.4.2.1.
